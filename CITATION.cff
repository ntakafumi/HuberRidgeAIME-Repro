  This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and dependencies needed
  to reproduce all tables and figures reported in the paper
  'HuberRidgeAIME: Robust Model-Agnostic Explanations under Outliers
  and Multicollinearity'. It provides an implementation of HuberRidgeAIME
  and baseline explainers, together with scripts to regenerate the reported
  results.
